Barber Reservation System 💈
Overview
This is a full-stack web application built to handle appointment bookings for a barber shop. Customers can easily view available barbers and time slots on a selected day and book an appointment accordingly.

The project is developed using:

Backend: Java + Spring Boot (REST APIs)

Frontend: React.js

Database: MySQL

It focuses on providing a seamless and efficient reservation experience for both customers and barbers.

Key Features 🚀
Customer Registration & Login: Secure signup/login for customers.

Barber Management: Barbers can have customized available times per day.

Appointment Booking:

Customers select a date.

See available barbers and their free slots.

Book a reservation in real-time.

Admin Panel (optional if you made): Manage barbers, appointments, and customers.

Booking Status Update: Customers can cancel or reschedule appointments.

Conflict Management: Prevents double-booking of the same time slot.

Real-Time Availability: Instant update of free slots after each booking.

Tech Stack ⚙️
Backend: Java, Spring Boot (MVC Architecture, RESTful APIs)

Frontend: React.js (Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation)

Database: MySQL (JPA/Hibernate ORM for database interaction)

Other Tools: Postman (API Testing), Maven (Build Tool)

Database Structure 📊
Customers Table: Stores customer information.

Barbers Table: Stores barber profiles and availability slots.

Appointments Table: Stores details of each booking (customer, barber, date, time).

How It Works 🔥
Customer signs up/logs in.

Selects a preferred date.

Views all barbers available along with free time slots.

Books an appointment by choosing a time slot.

Clean separation between backend logic and frontend UI.

Secure API endpoints and authentication flow.

Scalability: Easily extendable for multiple shops/branches.

Future Enhancements 🔮
Notification system (email/SMS) for booking confirmations.
